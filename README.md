zCms
====

ZCMS Core module. is intended to serve as a basic content management system.  Where most CMS's are basically page and image management systems, this will
aim to provide clustered enterprise level full content management functionality.  Unfortunately this means that database usage is more intensive than
most simple page managers like Wordpress and so forth, it is by no means designed for the average user.  The true benefits of zcms will not be realized until it
is moved to a multi regional clustered environment.  With the option to also install the module to provide static content to your existing zf2 application.
